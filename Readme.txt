 I have taken two applications one is randomizer and other is PrimeRandomizer.
 So in my first class that is randomizer i am using random function to generate series of positive numbers and the generated numbers are used in prime randomizer class to check whether the generated number is prime or not. If the number is prime then the number is stored in a queue and returns a boolean value as true if not the number is still stored in queue and return boolean value as false,
  Sample output :
8
27
22
49
43
73
96
83
82
85
false
false
false
false
false
true
false
true
false
true
